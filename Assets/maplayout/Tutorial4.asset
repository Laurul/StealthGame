  sentances:
  - In different places of the map you will be able to see special tiles
  - Using the action button when on the tiles will allow you to go to a secret path
    underground
  - These paths can be used as shortcuts to access new or secret areas in the level
    as well
  - You can use the underground paths to evade enemies as well
  - Going underground will continiously consume energy. If the energy is depleted
    then health will be consumed
  - Once out of the underground path there will be a short cooldown rendering you
    unable to use any vent for a period of time
  - Scout ahead and manage your resources well so you are not caught offguard when
    exiting and underground path
